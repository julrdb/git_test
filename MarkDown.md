# This is heading 1
> Pessimists sound smart. Optimists make money. ~Nat Friedman

## This would be heading 2
**To write in bold, highlight then** `CMD+B`

_To italicize, highlight then_ `CMD+I`

~~Strikethrough would be~~ `~~words~~`

***For All important, it's*** `***words***`

## We can stick to this size heading (h2)...
**Bold and _nestled_ italic** `**insert _words_ here**`
#### This is heading 4, you get the idea now.
###### Heading 6 is the last heading format.
